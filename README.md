# Currency-Converter
This Java program is a simple currency converter GUI application that allows users to convert between Indian Rupees (INR) and US Dollars (USD). Here's a breakdown of the code:

The Currency Converter project is a Java application that allows users to convert amounts between Rupees and Dollars. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can enter the amount in either Rupees or Dollars and convert it to the other currency using a predefined conversion rate.
The main features of the Currency Converter project include:
GUI: The application uses the Swing library to create a user-friendly GUI. It includes labels, text fields, and buttons to input the amount, display the converted amount, and perform the conversion.
Conversion Rate: The project defines a constant variable called CONVERSION_RATE, which represents the conversion rate between Rupees and Dollars. This rate is used to calculate the converted amount based on the user's input.
Conversion Logic: The application includes event listeners for the "Convert to USD" and "Convert to INR" buttons. When a button is clicked, the corresponding listener retrieves the amount entered by the user, performs the conversion calculation using the conversion rate, and displays the converted amount in the respective text field.
Error Handling: The project includes error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric characters. If an error occurs, a dialog box is displayed to notify the user and prompt them to enter a valid number.
Close Functionality: The application includes a "Close" button that allows the user to exit the application by closing the window.
Overall, the Currency Converter project provides a simple and intuitive way for users to convert amounts between Rupees and Dollars using a graphical interface. It demonstrates the use of Java Swing for creating GUIs, event handling, and basic error handling.
